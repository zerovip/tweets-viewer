# tweets-viewer
An offline tool to load your tweet.js in official archieve and view all your tweets.

## Motivation

The twitter’s [official archive viewer](https://twitter.com/settings/download_your_data) sucks:

1. Twitter has a character limit of 280. So usually you have to reply to yourself to make your tweets thread together. However, in the official archive viewer, “Tweets” and “Replies” are separate and thus you lost your threads.
2. It only shows the tweet date and no time.
3. It shows all the links in the `t.co` twitter link format, which is super annoying.

So I made this tool hoping to have a good experience when reviewing my tweets.

## Features

Offline, simple, neat, easy to use, easy to modify and powerful.

## Uasge

1. Download your twitter archive and unzip it;
2. Download/clone this repo and open the `viewer.html` in a browser;
3. Select and open the `data/tweet.js` in your unzipped archive folder;
4. Have fun~
